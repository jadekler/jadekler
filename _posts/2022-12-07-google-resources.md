# Engineering resources from Google

This is a collection of extremely useful internal resources, which are made
publicly available. I thought I'd share these, since they are a bit hard to find
externally. And, they really are fantastic - years and years of tweaks and
discussions and refinement have gone into these, from some of the great minds
of computer science.

So, enjoy, as I have:

## The "SWE book"

[https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book)

The "SWE book" - Google Engineering Practices Documentation. A classic.

## The "SRE book"

[https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/)

Another classic, more on the operation side of things.

## How to code review

[https://google.github.io/eng-practices/](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/)

The page is called "Google Engineering Practices Documentation" because the
internal version is more broad, but the external version has the bits about how
reviewers and reviewees of code changes should interact. These are _fantastic_
guidelines for a healthy engineering culture.

## The Go style guide

[https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/)

How to write "good" Go code at Google. Some of it is convention, but a lot of it
is sensical and very well thought out rules of the road when writing Go code.

(I'm biased, having contributed some of these sections!)

## Other language style guides

[https://google.github.io/styleguide/](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)

Well, I mostly care about Go, hence the callout, but here are the other language
styleguide.

I'll also call out the C++ as being fantastic. I've not used the others as much
but I expect them all to be of a very high quality.

# Post-note

I will continue editing this article as I find more. Stay tuned!

(I wonder if this will turn into a "How to re-create Google's engineering department in your company"... ðŸ¤”)
