![](/assets/me.jpg)

I'm Jean (pronounced Jean as in Jean Luc Picard). I'm originally from South
Africa (Cape Town area), but I've lived in England (Hertfordshire) and Sweden
(Stockholm) before moving to the US. I originally moved to Raleigh, North
Carolina, where I attended North Carolina State University for Math and Computer
Science. Now I live Colorado!

I work on:

- Network infrastructure: software that forecasts and plans the growth of Google's planet scale network.
- Go: I contribute to the Go project primarily in tooling, modules, and documentation.

I've also worked on [grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) and Google Drive.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy, climbing, mountain biking,
skiing, learning languages (French right now!), cooking, and spending time with
my wonderful Colorado community.

You can sometimes find me on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
under the ID deklerk.
