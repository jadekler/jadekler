I'm Jean (pronounced Jean as in Jean Luc Picard). I'm originally from South Africa (Cape Town area - pictured above!), but I've lived in England (Hertfordshire) and Sweden (Stockholm) before moving to the US. I originally moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, where I attended North Carolina State University for Math and Computer Science. Now I live Colorado!

I work on:

- ObjFS: a FUSE-based file system for build outputs as part of Google's massively distributed build pipeline.
- Go: I contribute to the Go project primarily in tooling ([x/tools/cmd/digraph](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/digraph), [x/exp/cmd/gorelease](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/cmd/gorelease), and others).

I've also worked on [grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go), [GCP client libraries](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go), Network Infrastructure, and Google Drive.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy, writing, climbing, mountain biking, skiing, learning languages, cooking, and spending time with my community.

You can sometimes find me on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) under the ID deklerk, or by emailing me at [deklerk@google.com](mailto:deklerk@google.com).
