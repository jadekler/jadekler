I'm Jean (pronounced Jean as in Jean Luc Picard). I'm originally from South
Africa (Cape Town area), but I've lived in England (Hertfordshire), Sweden
(Stockholm), before moving to the US. I now live in the best state in the
USA - Colorado!

I work on [Go client libraries for GCP](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go)
at Google, as well as contributing to the Go project (primarily tooling and
modules). I've also worked on [grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go)
and Google Drive.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, climbing, mountain biking, skiing, learning
languages, cooking, and spending time with my wonderful Colorado community.

You can usually find me on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
under the ID deklerk.
