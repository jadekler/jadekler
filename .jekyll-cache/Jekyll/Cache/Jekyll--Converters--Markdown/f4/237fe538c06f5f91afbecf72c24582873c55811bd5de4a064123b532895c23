<p>I’m Jean (pronounced Jean as in Jean Luc Picard). I’m originally from South
Africa (Cape Town area), but I’ve lived in England (Hertfordshire), Sweden
(Stockholm), before moving to the US. I now live in the best state in the
USA - Colorado!</p>

<p>I work on <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go">Go client libraries for GCP</a>
at Google, as well as contributing to the Go project (primarily tooling and
modules). I’ve also worked on <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go">grpc-go</a>
and Google Drive.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading, climbing, mountain biking, skiing, learning
languages, cooking, and spending time with my wonderful Colorado community.</p>

<p>You can usually find me on the <a href="https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/">Gophers Slack</a>
under the ID deklerk.</p>
